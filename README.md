# üóÑÔ∏è R Code Archive for Kieran Healy's Data Visualization Book

The notebook included in this repository is an archive of all the code I ran and corrected for Kieran Healy's book [*Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction 1st Edition*](https://amzn.to/2vfAixM). My initial plan for this book was to learn data visualization with the programming side using R: I have accomplished this task and finished the book. The archive is shared here for anyone else that takes a chance at this amazing work since the book was published back in 2018 there are some deprecated parameters. It's also difficult to find the code for the themeing function `theme_book()`. Healy and no one that has worked on this book ceased helping their readers troubleshoot errors as seen from the past 2 years in the issues section of the [socviz repository](https://github.com/kjhealy/socviz).

The archived code however has a few issues:
+ I wasn't too strapped to organize the code: however, there are relevant headings for each chapter.
+ The few quizzes included in the book are intentionally skipped over. 
+ There may be 1 or 2 errors in the code from the book that I was not able to resolve.

## üìì Thoughts on Google Collab
I realized a while back that collab has an option to let anyone change the language from Python to R, so I took up that opportunity since I did not want my already storage constrained laptop losing more storage because of these large packages that needed to be installed. The only downside for this approach is when the runtime expires and needs to be reactivated: the packages will have to be resintalled--which isn't a big issue with some of them that are small but the big ones take a considerable amount of time. If you're working with this book, I recommend finishing the chapter that requires that package to prevent having to install it over and over again. Also, doing this with the packages accustoms you to the tools you have in your disposal and gives you a great idea of what functions come from where making it so when you come back again you can recall a bit better every time.

If you want to create your own R-centric google collab, you can launch a notebook that does that through a url: https://colab.to/r.
