# data-viz-healy

The notebook included in this repository is an archive of all the code I ran and corrected for Kieran Healy's book *Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction 1st Edition*. My initial plan for this book was to learn data visulization with the programming side using R: I have accomplished this task and finished the book. The archive is shared here for anyone else that takes a chance at this amazing work.

The archived code however has a few issues:
+ I wasn't too strapped to organize the code: however, there are relevant headings for each chapter.
+ The few quizzes included in the book: I intentionally skipped over.
