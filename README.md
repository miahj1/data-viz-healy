The notebook included in this repository is an archive of all the code I ran and corrected for Kieran Healy's book [*Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction 1st Edition*](https://amzn.to/2vfAixM). My initial plan for this book was to learn data visualization with the programming side using R: I have accomplished this task and finished the book. The archive is shared here for anyone else that takes a chance at this amazing work since the book was published back in 2018 there are some deprecated parameters. It's also difficult to find the code for the themeing function `theme_book()`. Healy and no one that has worked on this book ceased helping their readers troubleshoot errors as seen from the past 2 years in the issues section of the [socviz repository](https://github.com/kjhealy/socviz).

The archived code however has a few issues:
+ I wasn't too strapped to organize the code: however, there are relevant headings for each chapter.
+ The few quizzes included in the book are intentionally skipped over. 
+ There may be 1 or 2 errors in the code from the book that I was not able to resolve.
